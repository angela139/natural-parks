## üß© Features & Notes

### üíª Image Modal for Desktop

On desktop viewports, clicking an image opens a **modal** that enlarges it for better visibility. Users can close it with the close button on the top right.

### üíª Image Carousel for Mobile

On mobile viewports, the image gallery turns into a carousel where users can use the arrow buttons to flip through the different park images. If I had more time, I would add a mobile modal to allow users to see the enlarged image on their phones as well. 

### üé• Animation Reference

Using animations with [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev), I animated the landing image with a parallax effect to show off more of the image. The text on the landing image also fades in and out through a smooth opacity change. The 3 park images have a slide in and fade in effect as well that's activated through scroll.
